# Container Images

## agentic-controller-agent

Minimal agent image owned by the controller for verification and
testing. Used by:
- Gateway verification Jobs (connectivity check)
- E2E tests (proves the controller → Sandbox → Pod pipeline)

This is NOT the production agent base image. The real agent images
(harness, goose runtime, language toolchains) are Stream 4 work
tracked in the [agent-base-image-composition enhancement](https://github.com/konveyor/enhancements/pull/296).

```bash
make controller-agent-build                           # build locally
make controller-agent-push CONTAINER_TOOL=podman      # push to quay
```

## Agent images

Production agent image hierarchy. Skills are mounted at runtime via
SkillCards, not baked into images.

```

`agent-images-push` pushes single-arch images under the same `:latest`
tags CI's multi-arch build publishes — running it against the real quay
repos overwrites the multi-arch manifest with a single-arch image. Use it
only for scratch/dev registries; for quay, use the multi-arch targets
below.

Both `controller` and `agentic-controller-agent` (built by the
`controller`/`controller-agent` jobs in `images.yml`) remain amd64-only —
"multi-arch" here covers the agent-base + language image hierarchy, not
end-to-end Sandbox clusters running on arm64.

### Multi-arch builds

In CI, all five images (agent-base + the four language images) build for
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` via
[konveyor/release-tools](https://github.com/konveyor/release-tools)
shared `build-push-images.yaml` reusable workflow: each arch builds
natively on its own runner and pushes under an arch-suffixed tag, then a
final job assembles those into a manifest list under the real tag.
agent-base publishes first so the language images' `FROM
quay.io/konveyor/agent-base` resolves against an already-published,
genuinely multi-arch manifest.

Publishing lives in `image-build-push.yml`, a dedicated workflow
with no `paths:` filter. This is separate from `images.yml` because
GitHub gates `push` events on both `tags:`/`branches:` and `paths:` — tag
pushes would not reliably fire under a `paths:` filter. The workflow
triggers on pushes to `main`, `release-*` branches, and `v*` tags:

- **`main`** pushes tag images as `:latest`.
- **`v*`** tag pushes tag images with the version (e.g. `:v0.11.0`) —
  the reusable workflow derives the tag from `github.ref_name`.
- **`release-*`** branch pushes tag images with the branch name.

`images.yml` keeps the `paths:`-filtered PR artifact builds and the
controller/controller-agent build+push jobs.

For local testing without pushing to CI, the same two platforms can be
built with podman directly (Linux hosts need `qemu-user-static` installed
for cross-arch emulation; macOS's podman machine ships with it):

```bash
make agent-images-multiarch-build                    # build both platforms locally, no push
make agent-images-multiarch-push                     # build and push multi-arch manifests to quay
```

These local targets build agent-base first under a `localhost/...` tag
rather than its real quay.io tag — `--platform` forces podman's pull
policy to "newer" for any name that resolves to a real registry, so
building directly under the real name would let podman silently pull the
already-published image from quay instead of using the multi-arch
manifest just built locally under that same name. Real tags are only
attached at push time, and the language builds also pass `--pull=never`
to make the local-only intent explicit. The reusable CI workflow above
avoids this altogether by pushing each arch under its own explicit tag
before ever assembling the manifest.

### PR artifacts

On a pull request, images aren't pushed anywhere — instead `images.yml`
builds all five images for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` and
uploads each as a downloadable per-arch workflow artifact
(`<image>--pr<N>-<arch>`, e.g. `agent-java--pr148-amd64`), via
[konveyor/ci](https://github.com/konveyor/ci)'s shared `build-image`
action (the same one analyzer-lsp's `demo-testing.yml` uses,
transitively, via `e2e-image-build.yaml`):

1. `agent-base-artifact` builds agent-base per arch and uploads
   `agent-base--pr<N>-<arch>`.
2. `agent-lang-images-artifact` (needs agent-base-artifact) builds each
   language image per arch, downloading and loading the matching
   agent-base artifact as its `BASE_IMAGE` build-arg.

Each per-arch tar is a plain `podman load`-able single-arch image (`docker
load` works too) — grab the one matching your machine's architecture to
test it locally; it loads as `localhost/<image>:pr<N>-<arch>`. Artifacts
expire after 1 day.

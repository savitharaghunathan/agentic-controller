# Agentic Controller

Kubernetes controller for managing AI agent workloads. Defines CRDs
under the `konveyor.io` API group and controllers for composing and
executing agent workloads via [Agent Sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox).

## Overview

The controller follows the Tekton Task/TaskRun pattern: an **Agent**
declares what is available (skills, gateways (provider/model combinations), container image,
prompt, typed parameters) and an **AgentRun** supplies concrete values
(gateway selection, parameter values, instructions) to trigger execution.

The controller is domain-agnostic. It does not call Hub, Backstage, or
any inventory system. Parameter values are opaque — the controller
validates and passes them through. The creator of the AgentRun (UI, CLI,
CI pipeline) resolves application metadata before creating the CR.

### CRDs

| CRD | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **SkillCard** | One skill or rule, from an OCI image, a git repository, or inline content. Assembled into `/opt/skills/{name}/` at pod init, where `{name}` is the skill's own frontmatter name. |
| **SkillCollection** | Group of skills. Points at an OCI image holding several, in which case the controller writes a SkillCard per skill it finds, or references existing SkillCards. |
| **Gateway** | LLM service endpoint serving one provider/model combination. |
| **Agent** | Template declaring available skills, gateways, container image, prompt, and typed parameters. |
| **AgentRun** | Execute a single Agent with specific values. Creates an Agent Sandbox. |
| **AgentWorkflow** | Ordered sequence of stages, each referencing an Agent. |
| **AgentWorkflowRun** | Execute a workflow. Creates AgentRuns sequentially per stage. |

### Key design decisions

- **Agent Sandbox** is a hard dependency for workload execution
- **Git credentials** stay in the entry point — the agent does not receive
  push credentials
- **Skills** are Agent Skills directories, delivered as ordinary OCI images
  mounted via ImageVolumes (K8s 1.33+), git clones, or inline content
- **Workspaces** are ephemeral — git is the persistence layer
- **ACP over HTTP** (via `goose serve`) provides real-time observability
  and human-in-the-loop interaction
- **Hub** provides curated REST endpoints for the UI

See `docs/adr/` for the full set of architecture decision records.

## Authoring images and skills

- [Create an agentic base image](docs/agent-base-images.md) — extend
  `agent-base`, build language images, publish them, and understand the
  harness contract.
- [Create a SkillCard image](docs/skill-card-images.md) — author, validate,
  package, publish, and reference skills and rules.

## Getting started

See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for a
step-by-step guide to deploying the controller, configuring a Gateway
with LLM credentials, and creating your first AgentRun.

## End-to-end testing

See [test/e2e/README.md](test/e2e/README.md) for Kind setup and commands for
the full pipeline, skill delivery, workflow reconciliation, and Go E2E suites.

                            applied verbatim, so no Gateways or gateway refs
  config/samples/         Illustrative CRs you copy and edit (per-provider

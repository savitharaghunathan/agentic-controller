description: >
  Reads a project and a goal statement, then produces PLAN.md in the repo root.
  The plan is specific to THIS project — real file paths, real dependencies, real
  layer ordering. Uses graphify to generate a code graph, then selectively reads
  complex files. Does NOT execute any changes. Output is always PLAN.md and
  nothing else. Use when starting a new migration to create the migration plan
  before any code changes.

# Plan Stage

Reads the project, understands the goal, writes `PLAN.md`.
Does NOT modify any source files — planning only.

## References

- [references/migration-plan-skill.md](references/migration-plan-skill.md) —
  detailed planning methodology with graph-powered discovery, selective reading
  strategy, and reference-driven plan generation
- [references/migration-phases.md](references/migration-phases.md) — generic
  migration phase guidance for migration types without a specific reference

## How This Works

1. **Reference-Driven**: You read a migration reference file (e.g., `javaee-quarkus.md`) that contains:
   - Migration order (layer dependencies)
   - Import/package transformations
   - Pattern catalog (before/after examples for complex changes)
   - Files to delete/create
   - Verification commands

2. **Graph-Powered**: The code graph (graph.json) provides:
   - Architectural layers (communities)
   - File relationships (edges)
   - High-risk files (god nodes)
   - Which files match which patterns (imports, annotations)

3. **Selective Reading**: You DON'T read every file. You:
   - Read the build manifest (1 file)
   - Read the reference (1 file)
   - Read 5-8 complex source files that need structural changes
   - Use the graph for everything else (imports, annotations, counts)

4. **Output**: Detailed PLAN.md with:
   - Specific file paths (from graph)
   - Specific transformations (from reference)
   - Correct layer order (from reference + graph communities)
   - Complex patterns marked with COMPLEX (from reference + god nodes)

## Phase 1 — Generate Code Graph

Run graphify on the project:

```bash
graphify update
```

This produces `graph.json` in the repo root.

---

## Phase 2 — Understand the Goal

Your overall migration goal is provided in the prompt above under
"Migration Context" and "Stage Task". Parse these to extract:

- **What** needs to change (e.g. javax to jakarta, Python 2 to 3, .NET Framework to .NET 8)
- **Scope** — all files? specific layers? specific patterns?
- **Target state** — what does "done" look like?
- **Constraints** — anything to preserve, avoid, or be careful about?

---

## Phase 3 — Discover the Project

### 3a. Read the Graph

Read `graph.json` to understand the project architecture:

1. **Communities (architectural layers)**:
   - Community 0 might be build files (pom.xml, package.json)
   - Smaller communities often = data models (few dependencies)
   - Medium communities = services, business logic
   - Large, high-degree communities = API/controllers

2. **God nodes (high-risk abstractions)**:
   - Nodes with degree > 20 are central to the system
   - Mark these as COMPLEX in the plan
   - Changes here ripple across many files

3. **Dependency flow**:
   - Use edges to understand: who depends on what?
   - Models → Services → Controllers (typical layering)

### 3b. Match Patterns to Graph

Check which migration patterns exist in the graph:

**Example (if a Java EE migration skill is loaded)**:
- Look for nodes where `attrs.annotations` contains `@MessageDriven` → Mark as COMPLEX
- Look for nodes where `attrs.imports` contains `javax.ejb` → EJB conversion needed
- Count nodes where `attrs.imports` contains `javax.persistence` → simple import replacement

### 3c. Build Migration Order

Map graph communities to migration layers:
- Community 0 (1 file: pom.xml) → Layer 1: Build
- Community 28 (5 files: *Entity.java) → Layer 2: Models
- Community 91 (8 files: *Service.java) → Layer 3: Services
- Community 164 (12 files: *Controller.java) → Layer 4: API

This gives you the migration sequence WITHOUT reading every file.

---

## Phase 4 — Read Selectively (max 5-8 files)

### When to Read a Source File

**READ these**:
- Build manifest (pom.xml, package.json, .csproj) — ALWAYS
- Files matching complex patterns:
  - MDB conversions (before/after structure is very different)
  - Security config changes
  - Lifecycle listeners (e.g., WebLogic ApplicationLifecycleListener)
  - JNDI lookups that need refactoring
- God nodes (high-degree) that use complex patterns

**DON'T READ these** (the graph is enough):
- Files that only need import changes (javax → jakarta)
- Files that only need annotation changes (@Stateless → @ApplicationScoped)
- Simple entity/model classes
- Simple REST controllers with basic CRUD

**Rules:**
- Read ONE file at a time
- Read ONLY files where the graph is not enough
- If uncertain about a file, mark the step COMPLEX and move on
- Total: ~8-10 file reads across all phases

---

## Phase 5 — Write PLAN.md

Write `PLAN.md` to the project root with this structure:

```markdown
# PLAN.md

## Goal
<restate the goal in one sentence>
- Reference used: <name of reference file, or "none">

## Project Summary
- Type: <Maven/Node/Python/.NET/etc>
- Files affected: <N>
- Estimated complexity: <Low/Medium/High>
- Hardest steps: <list the 1-3 most complex items>

## Steps

### Step 1: <title>
- File: <exact path from repo root>
- Action: <CREATE | MODIFY | DELETE>
- What to do: <specific instructions for this file>
- Why: <reason — what pattern is being changed>
- Depends on: <step numbers this must come after, or "none">
- Verify: <how to know this step is done correctly>

### Step 2: <title>
...

## Verification
<exact command(s) to run after all steps are done>

## Notes
<gotchas, special cases, decisions made>
```

### Rules for writing steps

1. **One file per step** — never combine two files in one step
2. **Exact paths** — use real paths from graph.json, not placeholders
3. **Dependency order** — steps that others depend on come first
4. **Layer order** — build config → app config → utils → persistence → models → services → REST/controllers → tests → cleanup/deletions
5. **Hard steps flagged** — add `COMPLEX:` prefix to title for MDB, JNDI, architecture changes, lifecycle listeners
6. **DELETE steps last** — after all modifications are done

### Step detail levels

**Mechanical** (simple find-replace changes):
```markdown
### Step 5: Migrate imports in Order.java
- File: src/main/java/com/example/model/Order.java
- Action: MODIFY
- What to do: Replace all `javax.persistence.*` → `jakarta.persistence.*`
- Why: Quarkus uses Jakarta EE namespace
- Depends on: Step 1
- Verify: No `javax.` imports remain in file
```

**Complex** (structural/architectural changes):
```markdown
### Step 14: COMPLEX — Convert message listener to new API
- File: <path>
- Action: MODIFY
- What to do:
    - BEFORE: <old pattern — e.g., @MessageDriven listener with JMS API>
    - AFTER: <new pattern — e.g., @Incoming reactive consumer>
    - Specific changes:
        1. Remove: <old imports/annotations/methods>
        2. Add: <new imports/annotations>
        3. Replace: <method signatures, configuration>
    - Affected files: <list config files that also need updates>
- Why: <why the old pattern is not supported>
- Depends on: Step X (prerequisite changes), Step Y (configuration)
- Verify: <grep checks, compile commands>
```

## Phase 6 — Write Result

After writing PLAN.md, append your result to `.konveyor/result.json`:

```bash
mkdir -p .konveyor
```

If the file exists, read it, parse the JSON array, append your entry,
and write it back. If it does not exist, create it with a single-entry array.

Your entry:

```json
{"stage": "plan", "status": "succeeded", "summary": "<1-2 sentences: what you found and what the plan covers>"}
```

Or on failure:

```json
{"stage": "plan", "status": "failed", "reason": "<what went wrong>", "summary": "<what was attempted>"}
```

---

## Important

- Do NOT modify source files — planning only
- Do NOT execute any migration steps
- Do NOT skip graphify — the graph is essential for later stages
- Read selectively — the graph gives you most of what you need
- Report which reference you used in the Goal section of PLAN.md
